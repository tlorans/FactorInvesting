**Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues**

*An eigenvector is a nonzero vector that satifies the equation:*

\begin{equation}
Av = \lambda v
\end{equation}

*Where $A$ is a square matrix, $\lambda$ is a scalar and $v$ is the eigenvector. $\lambda$ is called an eigenvalue. Eigenvalues are also known as latent roots and eigenvectors as latent vectors.*

**Orthogonal Matrix**

*A matrix A is orthogonal if:*

\begin{equation}
AA^T = A^TA = I
\end{equation}

*where $I$ is the identity matrix.*

For example:

\begin{equation}
A = 
\end{equation}
