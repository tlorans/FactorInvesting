# Net Zero Investing

Before the surge of net zero investors, insurers and asset managers alliances, climate investing mainly involved decarbonizing portfolios or constructing low-carbon indices with the low-carbon strategy that we have seen in the first part of this course.

But, as stated by Barahhou et al. (2022) {cite:p}`barahhou2022net`, net zero investing has changed the scope of climate investing, as the corresponding strategy cannot be considered as a simple tilt of a business-as-usual portfolio.

Indeed, according to the framework proposed by Barahhou et al. (2022), a net zero portfolio:

- has a dynamic decarbonization dimension, with portfolio alignment with a decarbonization pathway
- encompasses the transition dimension, to ensure that the portfolio is financing the transition towards a low-carbon economy

The purpose of this course is to give you an overview of a net zero strategy.
