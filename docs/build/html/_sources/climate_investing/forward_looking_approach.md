# Part 1: Net Zero Investing

In this first part of this course, we cover a dynamic portfolio decarbonization strategy: portfolio alignment.

A robust portfolio decarbonization strategy starts with a NZE scenario. We will thus cover in the first part how to derive a portfolio decarbonization pathway from a NZE scenario.

The second part of this course introduces the concept of portfolio alignment to a decarbonization pathway, such as the one proposed by Barahhou et al. (2022). It changes the nature of the portfolio decarbonization problem, from a static approach to a dynamic approach.

In a third and final section, we will focus on the concept of self-decarbonization and decarbonization backtesting, to ensure that the resulting portfolio has endogenized the decarbonization pathway, leading to a time-proofed portfolio alignment strategy, as advocated by Barahhou et al. (2022).
