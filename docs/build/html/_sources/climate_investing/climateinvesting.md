# Part 1: A Forward-Looking Climate Risk Hedging Strategy

In this first part of this course, we will tackle the question of climate risk integration in equity portfolios.

First, building upon the economics and physics of climate change, we recognize that transition risk, and especially carbon risk is the most immediate climate risk to take into account into equity investing, given the tragedy of the horizon.

Second, given the noisy nature of a potential systematic carbon risk priced-in by the market, we will follow Andersson et al. (2016)  {cite:p}`andersson2016hedging` and Roncalli (2023) by considering a fundamental-based approach (ie. based on carbon emissions and / or carbon intensity) only.

Thus, the first section of this part is devoted to the presentation of portfolio decarbonization as a climate risk hedging approach, as advocated by Andersson et al. (2016) and Roncalli (2023). It will forms the basis of the climate risk integration into portfolio construction in this course.

Starting from this first and simple approach, we will focus in a second section on the importance to start with a net zero emissions (NZE) scenario and the corresponding portfolio's decarbonization pathway in order to build a dynamic climate risk integration strategy, as shown by Barahhou et al. (2022) {cite:p}`barahhou2022net`.

In a third section, we will focus on the concept of self-decarbonization and decarbonization backtesting, to ensure that the resulting portfolio has endogenized the decarbonization pathway, leading to a time-proofed climate risk integration, as advocated by Barahhou et al. (2022).

Last but not least, the final section focuses on the transition dimension: that is how to ensure that the resulting climate risk integration strategy helps to finance the transition towards a low-carbon economy, by including green activities (Barahhou et al., 2022).
